# BaybayinConverter

This is the official Tagalog to Tagalog-Baybayin converter for JAVA. I will soon add more dependencies for other language.

# Usage - JAVA

To use this feature, you must first import the class

```java
import java.unirises.BConv;
```
then, you must initialize the class

```java
BConv bConv = new BConv("Unirises"); // You must pass a parameter inside the class.
```

after that, you must call the ```java convert()``` method to get the result.
but you must store it in a String.
```java
String converted = bConv.convert();
```

Will update to python soon!
